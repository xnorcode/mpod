# mpod Android app
mpod is a simple Android app project which helps users find their favourite artists in last.fm database.

In this project I utilized RxJava2, Dagger 2, OkHttp3, Room DB, ButterKnife and Picasso libraries.

Additionally I'm using the MVP design pattern in a Test Driven Development process performing local unit testing with Mockito as well as UI testing with Espresso.
